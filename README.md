Just some shit I slapped together, first time using ansible might fix later.

Used this to rebuild my Linstor/drbd mirrored SAN from a fresh proxmox install on the SANs

had to reinstall linstor/drbd quite a few times so i automated the process because it can be a pain to setup from catastrophic failure.

This is essentially just my notes and configs for my specific setup with nvme/RoCE
